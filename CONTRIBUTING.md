# Contributing to CastBay

Thanks for helping! Bug reports, device reports, translations, fixes and features are all welcome. English or Chinese are both fine in issues and discussions.

## Before you start

- **Questions and ideas**: [Discussions](https://github.com/weenas/castbay/discussions).
- **A bug**: a [problem report](https://github.com/weenas/castbay/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml). Uploading a report from the app (About → Diagnostics → Upload log) and giving its ID helps a lot.
- **A security issue**: report it privately; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **A bigger change** (a new feature, a new dependency, a change to the protocol code): open an issue or discussion first, so we can agree on the approach before you spend time on it.

## Building and testing

[README.md](README.md) explains how to build the app ([Building from Source](README.md#building-from-source)) and the website ([Website](README.md#website)), and how to test without a phone with `tools/sim` ([Testing without a phone](README.md#testing-without-a-phone)).

Before opening a pull request:

- `./gradlew assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest` passes; for the website, `npm run build` in `web/`.
- You tried the change on a device or an emulator: a remote (D-pad) and, where it matters, a touch screen. Screens should work on a 1080p TV (960×540 dp), a car display (about 1280×600 dp) and a tablet held upright.
- New text the app shows is in both `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` (English) and `values-zh/strings.xml` (Chinese). If you can only write one, say so in the pull request.

## Pull requests

- One topic per pull request, with a description of what changes for the person using CastBay and how you tested it.
- Commit messages in English: a short summary line, then why the change is needed.
- Follow the style of the code around your change: Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, comments that explain why rather than what.
- Don't change `versionName` / `versionCode`; they change only when a release is made.
- CI builds the app and the website; a maintainer merges once it passes and the change is reviewed.

## Translations

The app is in English and Chinese. To add a language, copy `values/strings.xml` to `values-<code>/strings.xml` (for example `values-ja`) and translate it; keep placeholders such as `%1$s` and escape apostrophes (`\'`).
