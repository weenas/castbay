## Supported casting features

CastBay supports **AirPlay screen mirroring, music and video casting from compatible apps, and DLNA/UPnP media playback**. Support is described by the features tested below, not a blanket “AirPlay 2” claim. Full AirPlay 2 support, including multi-room synchronized audio, is not claimed.

| Feature | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| AirPlay screen mirroring | Tested with iPhone and Mac; iPad is not yet confirmed |
| AirPlay music | Tested with iPhone apps listed below; the Mac Music app is not supported |
| AirPlay video casting | Tested with compatible apps listed below; support varies by app and content |
| DLNA/UPnP media playback | Receives media from compatible apps; not Android screen mirroring |
| AirPlay 2 multi-room synchronized audio | Not supported |

## TVs and car displays

| Device | Android | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sony BRAVIA XR-55X90L (4K) | 12 | ✅ Tested: H.265 mirroring in 4K, everything else |
| TCL TV | 9 | ✅ Tested |
| Xiaomi TV 4 (MiTV4, Amlogic, 32-bit) | 6.0.1 | ✅ Tested: mirroring from an iPhone, music; about 0.3 s of decoding latency, more than newer TVs |
| Google TV Streamer | 14 | ✅ Installed and running; hardware HEVC (4K mirroring on a 4K screen) |
| BYD car display, DiLink 5.0 (touch screen) | 12 | ✅ Tested: mirroring, music, video, steering-wheel buttons (pause, change tracks); force-stopped when switched off, so open CastBay after starting the car |

CastBay needs an Android device on Android 6.0 or later. Other brands of TVs, TV boxes, car displays and tablets should work, with a remote or a touch screen; 4K H.265 mirroring needs a TV with a hardware HEVC decoder (the home screen says what it offers).

## Phones and computers

| Device | System | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iPhone 17 Pro Max | iOS 26 | ✅ Tested: mirroring, music, video, PIN pairing |
| Samsung Galaxy (Android phone) | Android 16 | ✅ Tested: DLNA from NetEase Cloud Music |
| iPad | iPadOS | ❔ Not yet confirmed; uses the same AirPlay as an iPhone |
| MacBook: screen mirroring | macOS | ✅ Tested: mirroring in 1080p and 4K; for latency see the [FAQ](/faq) |
| Mac: the Music app | macOS | ❌ Not supported: it uses an encryption the open-source AirPlay library can't handle |

## Apps

| App | How | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Music | AirPlay | ✅ Lyrics in sync; pausing and resuming pick up where they left off |
| NetEase Cloud Music (iPhone) | AirPlay | ✅ Works; after a pause from the TV, what the TV has plays out for a couple of seconds |
| NetEase Cloud Music (Android) | DLNA | ⚠️ Plays, with titles and cover; the phone's play state isn't always in step |
| YouTube (iPhone) | AirPlay | ✅ Up to 4K on 4K TVs; the TV must be able to reach YouTube itself |
| YouTube (Android) | — | ❌ Only casts with Google Cast, which CastBay can't receive |
| iQiyi | AirPlay, screen mirroring | ✅ Works |
| Bilibili | DLNA | ⚠️ Works, up to 720p (Bilibili's limit for other devices) |
| QQ Music | DLNA | ❔ Not yet confirmed |
| Any app | Screen mirroring | ✅ Whatever is on the phone's screen |

## Not supported

- **Google Cast (Chromecast)**: CastBay currently does not support Google Cast media casting or screen mirroring. Use AirPlay or DLNA instead.
- **Miracast and Android's own screen mirroring**: they need system access an app doesn't get.
